## Introduction:
The core concept of our project revolves around creating a comprehensive finance
application aimed at providing users with deep insights into their financial behaviors and patterns. Users will be able to add & enter their expenses either in a text format, audio format or within a form. It will also generate a summary based on user's expenditure and show interactive visualization based on user's expenditure patterns.
